# Deep Learning From Scratch
This is a collection of assignments and projects source code during my learning phase. In includes a few machine learning algorithms as well as CNN, RNN and transfer learning classes. <br />
# Machine Learning Algorithms <br />
Including a few classical machine learning algorithms, such as <br />
*logistic regression <br />
*least square fit <br />
*k-nearest neighbor <br />
*support vector machine <br />
# Convolutional Neural Network <br />
Implemented a convolutional neural network from numpy.
Including a few layer functions and built a sequential model using these layers. <br />
*convolutional layer <br /> 
*maxpooling layer <br />
*relu layer <br />
*faltten layer <br />
*fully connected layer <br />
*softmax layer <br />
*crossentropy layer <br />
# Transfer Learning Case <br />
Add a few transfer learning study cases, including <br />
*AlexNet + SVM <br />
*AlexNet + FullNet <br />
*InceptionV3 + SVM <br />
*InceptionV3 + FullNet <br />
The confusion plots as well as the accuracy report are lised inside /results
# Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) <br />
GRU is a simplified version of LSTM. <br />
* GRU for sentiment dataset(2 classes)<br />
* GRU for question dataset(50 classes)<br />
