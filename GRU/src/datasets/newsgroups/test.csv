From: steve-b@access.digex.com (Steve Brinich) Subject: How To Escrow` If Escrowing Were OK    There is a description of something called a "fair crypto system" in the May 1993 issue of BYTE` p. 134` attributed to MIT professor Silvio Micali.    The way it works is as follows:    You generate your private key S` and break it up into pieces s1` s2` s3` s4` and s5` such that (s1 + s2 + ... + s5) mod p = S.   You give each piece s1` s2` etc. to a different escrow agency.   The agencies each compute g^sn mod p` and forward the result to the public key telephone book keeper.   The public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the g^sn mod p` reduces the result to mod p` and this will be the user's public key.    Now` if there were several hundered recognized escrow agencies` and the user could give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted` the result would be something of an improvement over the proposed Clipper system.    I still don't think key escrow is a good idea` for both p,3

Well` I'm not sure I'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio filter DSP construction article in the Sept 92 issue of QST magazine (Ham Radio oriented).  The DSP is available in kit form for about $120.  This particular DSP filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove noise (static).  I built it and it really works well.  The source code is available too.  It makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear.

From: mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu (Mark Riordan) Subject: DOS 6.0 compression API: partial answer  For those of you looking for information on MS-DOS 6.0's file system compression API:  Today I called Microsoft's DOS 6.0 hotline at (800)228-7007. They told me that the DOS 6.0 Resource Kit had the specifications for the compression interface.  The Resource Kit costs $19.95` plus tax and $5 shipping.  I ordered a copy and will post further when I get it and know more about it.  I am posting now because the order turnaround is 15  working days.    If anyone knows for sure where's there's a good source of info on this API` please speak up.  I am  slightly skeptical about the Resource Kit's likelihood of having detailed programming info.

But if you can contrive to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE` it seems like a morality applies.  Now` there seem to be 3 alternatives:  1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene'` that is` not trying to think about anything evil` or indulgining in overly sexy or violent thoughts.  2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane') Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in common by more than one person.

He addressed this exact issue` and dismissed it rather quickly.  According to Gammons` advanced scouts are reporting that Morris' fastball and slider still have the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability to keep the ball hidden during his release.  Guzman and Stottlemyre have gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a little work with the pitching coach.  Gammons looks to see Morris back in top form within the month.  I` on the other hand` still have my doubts.  Morris' ERA last year was rather high for a pitcher who won 20 games.  His showing in the Series was not surprising.

The card supports just about any monitor scan rate you can think of (I used it at 640x480` 800x600 and 1024x768` but it can go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a software control panel.    This is the ACCELERATED version of the card` which means all QuickDraw  calls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card` freeing up the mac processor for other tasks.     The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last night was $1738 at Mac's Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is just over a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and the original manuals.    Hurry!  Chris Magnuson chrism@col.hp.com Hewlett-Packard Company (71,19

On a typical UPS (well` on ours` anyway)` there is NO switchover from AC to DC.

If the power fails` big deal -  the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop` but  there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet` so it  takes a while).  If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter` why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw things up` and no having to sense the failure fast.

Though the system may be imperfect` it is a long way from the horror stories some here seem to believe or anticipate.  --  David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of                          our information` errors and omissions excepted.     ,3

This is basically a share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk: what God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar. It makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers of any possible creature.  This is the "everlasting life" that the New Testament speaks of.  What Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying grace to the human race.  He instituted the Sacraments as the means by which this life is given to people` and its increase fostered.  The absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion from Heaven.

Some of the information in the posting requires some clarification` and I would like to answer some of the questions raised on sci.crypt.      SCT is a small company based in Silver Spring Maryland.  Our two main products at this time are a PC based secure communications program called SECOM and a general purpose encryption chip which uses the NEA algorithm developed for SECOM.      SECOM provides an encrypted secure communication link between two PC's connected over dial up telephone lines.  It supports simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboard to screen "chat".  It has its own proprietary communications protocol which is ,3

Abstracts of  the articles are appended.        This leads to the more general question: do yet other people than  the US` Russia` and Japan do space surveillance` and if so` how and  why?

March '93 Circuit Cellar has part one of an article about dimming 120VAC lamps` but it seems to lead into phase- control as the best method for controlling brightness.   I've always hated phase-control for the RFI` buzzing filaments and non-linear adjustment range. I had heard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle by cycle basis to get better results. To cut the lamp's power to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of AC` then nothing for another 20 cycles. I wonder if anyone has tried this or knows what the pro stuff is using.

From: scott@prism.gatech.edu (Scott Holt) Subject: hate the sin...  "Hate the sin but love the sinner"...I've heard that quite a bit recently`  often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality... but the context really isn't that important. My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not.  Hate begets more hate` never love. Consider some sin. I'll leave it unnamed since I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not  something is a sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see what happens. If we truly hate the sin` then the more we see it` the  stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so  strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner. In addition` our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and  do things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even  believe what they are doing is a sin). After eno,14

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu- tion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin- ing "best" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season` the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the "best" is the score of the game ,11

From: qman@casbah.acns.nwu.edu (Charlie Kuehmann) Subject: LCIII to VGA Monitor Adapters  I'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a VGA monitor (an IBM 8513 sold w/ many PS/2's to be exact) on the Mac LC III.  All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the sony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am I confused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used an LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?  I would prefer to get a apple monitor for these LCIII's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an IBM bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we can afford and the more PS/2's we can get rid of!

A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey said "the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal`" the  Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported.

Boston players can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net except for on rare occasions.  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds.  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but he's also getting plenty of help.

Here's my question:  CONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the          university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS)` and log on to my          account. When I installed SLIP on my computer` I had to configure it          for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone          number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that          I type "telnet uicvm" or "tn3270 uicvm" (either will work) at the DOS          prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then          dials the mainframe` establishes a protocol` and gives me the logon          screen. "TELNET" and "TN3270" are the names of batch files in my SLIP          directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the          session.  PROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this ,5

Either a second court order (for the specific serial/key) is required (and I have seen no indication of this)` or the FBI can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any time` so the escrow key holders are a total fake.

The Magellan mission at Venus continues normally` gathering gravity data which provides measurement of density variations in the upper mantle which can be correlated to surface topography.  Spacecraft performance is nominal.  2.  Magellan has completed 7225 orbits of Venus and is now 39 days from the end of Cycle-4 and the start of the Transition Experiment.  3.  No significant activities are expected next week` as preparations for aerobraking continue on schedule.  4.  On Monday morning` April 19` the moon will occult Venus and interrupt the tracking of Magellan for about 68 minutes.      ___    _____     ___     /_ /|  /____/   /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov     | | | |  __  /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/,4
From: lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady) Subject: Re: Science and methodology (was: Homeopathy ... tradition?)   Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also  widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity.  And in ordinary life` perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is  indicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case` a   perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might  make that he is unable to even leave the house.    In science` we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible  and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these  discoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata  --- the search for scope and the search for certainty.

From: jhawk@panix.com (John Hawkinson) Subject: Building a UV flashlight  Yes` I know it sounds crazy. Call it an urge. Call it what you want. Just don't ask why :-)  Anyway` I'd like to build a UV flashlight` cheaply. "flashlight" means it should be reasonably portable` but could have a power pack if necessary.  My main question is the bulb: where can I get UV bulbs? Do they need a lot of power? etc.` etc.  I'm not too concerned with whether it's long-wave or short-wave (but hey` if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs` I'll take both).

I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri- helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e)` i.e.` about 2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter` they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU. If 1977 was after the temporary capture` this means that the comet ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter's -- which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could get under Jupiter's influence.  > Also` perihelions of Gehrels3 were: >  > April  1973     83 jupiter radii > August 1970     ~3 ju,4

For    Isaiah says` 'Lord` who has believed our message?'  Consequently` faith    comes from hearing the message` and the message is heard through the word    of Christ."     So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the    gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids    are not yet spiritually` intellectually` or emotionally mature enough to    respond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot    be raised in baptism to a new life.  Catholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently` and that's one primary reason why they baptize babies.  They believe that Baptism produces a change in the soul of the baby` quite independently of any volitional act on the part of the baby.  This change in the baby's soul ,14

Here's a summary of the replies I received.         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I'm not under 25 anymore (but is 27 close enough).   1992 Dodge Stealth RT/Twin Turbo (300hp model). No tickets` no accidents` own a house` have taken defensive driving 1` airbag` abs` security alarm` single.   $1500/year  $500 decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100 for the $1`000`000 umbrella policy over my car and house)  The base policy is the standard $100`000 - $100`000 - $300`000 policy required in DE.   After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less.   I bought the car in September 1992.  The company I was with (never had and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2`500.   Hope this helps,9

It's a real nice card` but I'm having very big problems with it.    The basic problem is that vertical lines are missing from the display in windows. Something like every other line or so. Also` when I use a DOS gif viewer` namely vpic 6.0c` in Fahrenheit 1280 mode` vertical lines are swapped. It's very strange looking.

A common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is nothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by a preacher` or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings.  There is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman.

Since he isn't in the position to post this himself` he asked me to post it for him` but to leave his name out. So here it comes:  CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying` but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine` it has to do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its "current directory".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg` it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then` for 8 bit displays` it does the "dithering"` again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writin,18

An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and the car in front` but enough to manuver around it.  Keep the bike in 1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that for engaged/disengaged?)` until there are two cars stopped behind you.  When the next BDI cager comes screaching in` simply ride up along side of the car in front of you.  You don't need to panic and do it` or you will pop the clutch and stall the engine.

I know there is an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under System 7 But I can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it.  Is there a color version of MGR for Linux?  I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year,18

I have noticed that the waveform  synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large common mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred  times.

You order distinctive ringing from your phone company.  This is $3/month here. You get a second (unpublished) phone number.  When someone calls this number` your phone rings with short rings instead of long rings.  You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax on six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #. A device would measure the length of rings.  When it detects a short ring` it turns off your answering machine. Five rings later your fax picks up the call.  This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80 switches now available.  But that's not what I did.  I'm giving out the new # to my friends and customers.

The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE` it depends on the drive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr. it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly 4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340` you have figure out the jumper setting on the controller to get reliable diskaccess` fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest but does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast speed. I havent used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet`,15

I had to force quit` and then when I launched FC again it said the modem port was in use.  This is really strange.  I thought it might have to do with fax software.

Subject: Marlin fans From: csc2imd@cabell.vcu.edu (Ian M. Derby)   I was watching the Dodgers/Marlins game yesterday and a couple of things impressed me.    First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami` it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball.  In comparison Wrigley Field in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans.    The second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals! I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball. It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering` I thought it was the AFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it` but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities.    Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement.  We'll find out Friday how Denver Bronco fans respond.   Phillies,11

From: joel@cray.com (Joel Broude) Subject: Mevicore vs. Lopid vs. ?   I used to be on lopid.  It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295 down to around 214)` as well as LDL and triglycerides.  Then` I got pneumonia` and for some reason` the Lopid stopped working very well; cholesterol and triglycerides soared.  The levels might have stabilized over time` but a new doctor had me quit` wait a month` then switch to Mevicore.    On Mevicore` my total cholesterol was down to 207`  LDL was 108`  and HDL was 35; but the trig's were still very high` around 318` and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal`  SGOT = 83 (N = 1-35)`  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35).  He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern` and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol figures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal ("Just to be extra cautious` though I'm sure it's not a problem.")` and wants me to go back on it after that.  I suggest,6

At the beginning of this siege` it was reported that while Koresh had a class III (machine gun) license` today's paper quotes the government as saying` no` they didn't have a license.  Today's paper reports that a number of the bodies were found with shoulder weapons next to them` as if they had been using them while dying -- which doesn't sound like the sort of action I would expect from a suicide.

The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder mask that is used. Older boards (bakelite and phenolic) rarely used a solder mask (these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing and soldering techniques) and hence are the colour of the compound used to make them. These days boards are made of fibreglass for most general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent close traces shorting to one another during ,0

From: scott.frost@cas.org (Scott Frost) Subject: How to draw in Invert mode with Color    How can I draw an object of a specified color over objects of varying colors   and then erase it without having to redraw everything else?    What's happening is this`        If I draw it using GXcopy` it is drawn in the specified color.  If I erase       it using GXcopy with foreground and background reversed` it erases        whatever it overlayed.  I then need to redraw       all of the items it crossed.  Yuch.        If I draw it using GXinvert it is drawn in a random color - nothing        resembling what I requested.  It properly restores the color of        underlying objects in erase mode.

I'm thinking that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for sale` but I don't know any of the companies. Any info is greatly appreciated. 	In case you don't know` Krillean Photography` to the best of my knowledge` involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns or spikes around the object photographed` and depending on what type of object it is` the spikes or energy patterns will vary.

In X10` the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing requests;  that is` the server's drawing model was stateless.  This caused problems with performance and network traffic` so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify the drawing state.  Most application designers who want to draw things in several different colors create a GC for each color during initialization` then pass the GC id in each drawing request.

One of them is the ERA statistic for : pitchers. What does it say ??  ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game.  Thus` if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned run` his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs` thus his ERA is 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.  	ERA = (ER/IP) * 9  An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error.  More specifically` if an error occurs that represented the third out` all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs. Earned runs are also runs scored ,11

The runner can leave his base at any time.  If the ball is caught` he's got to tag up.  If it isn't caught` he _doesn't_ have to tag up at all.

Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who                themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS          from acupuncture needles. Generally` even if accidently inoculated` the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant  involved with acupuncture needle insertion.   Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They       do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of  diseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise "disposable needlesused here." These needles tend to be of a lower quality however`  being poorly manufactured and too "sharp" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.         ,6

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery  maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off` and if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and  the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data).

As a result Serbs did take a beating from Croats (NOT Bosnian Moslems) while Germany had the upper hand.  Even today` Russians consider/call Serbs as their Slovac brothers. This is one of the issues involved in the U.N.'s lack of active intervention against Serbs.  As for the Bosnian Moslems` I have not heard of any alliance with Germany or Russia in recent history.

For AT class and later machines` IRQ5 is reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel port in a PC` it's usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt.  On the other hand` we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1` a Mouse on COM2` and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight with a board when trying to use IRQ5` and discoverd the problem was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon as we disabled COM3` our problems went away.  Grumble ... after several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.  			~ Mike  (,15

I have two SCSI hard drives` each has 512KB of 'cache'.  There several reasons for this :-  When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be busy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and the data can be transmitted.  When the drive receives data to be written` the data can come down the bus faster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored somewhere while the disk is writing it out.  In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache!  May be the drive does some read-ade,15

The original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital but I can answer a few general points.  Elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after being in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even young people find the change unsettling.  Though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say - anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the elderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the change of situation is much more important.

Vibration when applying the brakes can be caused` on disc brakes at least` by warped rotors. When the brakes are applied` there results uneven pressure on the rotor.  Turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec).

Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized` I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.

I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now. The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi). The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.)  Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars` I don't know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items? Or is this an indication that the car was abused? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?

But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear (or is that high gear?) in game 3.  Except for a 10-15 minute stretch in the 2nd period` they outskated and outworked the Wings.  Please don't flame this statement 'cos you know it's true!  I have to admit that  goaltending was the key.  Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the Leafs went through in the 2nd.  He also kept the rebounds to a minimum` something that cost Cheveldae 2 goals.  Clark even looked like he had stopped moping (first star!)` although I still don't know why he was so flat in games 1 and 2.  If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game 3` they may actually have a chance of winning this series (a slim chance`  but a chance....I'm no RM.....where is he anyways? haha).

The Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1958 exempted from the draft those whose "religious training and belief" was opposed to participation in war in any form. It defined "R T & B" as "an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation` but [not including] essentially political` sociological` or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code."  In the 1965 case of UNITED STATES V. SEEGER` the Supreme Court broadened the definition so as not to restrict it to explicit theists.

As a self-proclaimed atheist` I believe that *some* conceptions of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact` and I lack belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no reason for me to believe in these.  I usually use the word agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of a god is unknown inherently unknowable.

So when you say that you met some 'rosicrucians' you mean "members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)   Response:  This makes much sense to me.  This is also true of most religions. There is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people who call themselves 'Hindus' or 'Christians' or 'Pagans' and actually *BEING* any of these.

Basically` sometimes when you quit Windows` the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen.  Also` sometimes when you exit to DOS` the same effect occurs. Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows' virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.  Neither company seems to know what I am talking about when I call them.  Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?    Is there a fix for it?  Any response is welcome.

From: armstrng@cs.dal.ca (Stan Armstrong) Subject: Sleeping with one's aunt  The last time we discussed homosexuality` I asked whether anyone could identify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the Bible prohibited` but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent harm to anyone. Put another way` the question is whether homosexual intercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe is immoral solely on the basis that God says it is` with no insight being offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my question in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting response based on Roman Catholic theology).  However` I think now that I can at least answer my first question. Link Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping with one's aunt.

Currently a cracker needs to find the _only_ (*1) key that produces the given ciphertext.  He has to try about 2^63 keys on the average.

From: maennig@veronica.informatik.uni-dortmund.de (Olaf Maennig) Subject: Problems with A/ROSE  Does anyone work with the A/ROSE card?  We have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the system` and lets crash the Mac then.  Okay` we don't use the card quite like one should` because we simulate errors in the 68000. Before every instruction some specified registers are masked` eg. to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits.  Normally` the "crash instance" of A/ROSE notices a crash` sets a flag and stops working. By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card crash. That works fine for almost all crashes` but as said` sometimes the card doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system.  The documentation of A/ROSE does not tell us anything about its behavior when crashing` and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing the assembler code` and that's both frustrating and lengthy.  So` can anyone help? Please only reply via email` as ,19

Fortunately` it doesn't itch.  The rash  always comes on the day after the fever breaks and no matter what the illness was:  cold` flu` whatever. It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current town` although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.  Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever: a severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash.  A mild fever seems to bring rashes that go away faster.    Anybody know what might be causing this?  It's no more than an  embarassment` but I'd be curious to know what's going on.

I would appreciate any comments about this and other 'new' technology for hearing aids.  The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and appears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that a new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in 'noisy' situations.  The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable)` apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies` while the important consonant information (unfortunately for me) is in the hi,6

I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet` but a couple of things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of weapon used in self defense.  1988` 1989` and 1990 refer only to "weapon." The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987` w/gun defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for this` I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem` and as such going  ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.

They` however` have indirectly created    the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist    Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.  2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and    other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and    outlaw state.  3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program.

From: Steven Ritter <sr0o+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject: Re: Pennsylvania Insurance` Limited Tort Option  In my opinion` the limited tort option is the best thing Casey has ever done. Basically` limited tort means that you give up your right to sue for pain and suffering` unless one of the following conditions is met: 1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X is some number like 50`000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number)  2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean` the OTHER driver was drunk)  3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically` you can appeal to regain your right to sue` but there's almost no chance of this ever happening).  You are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you can still sue for medical costs` actual damages` etc. By agreeing to limited tort` you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery.

From: s127@ii.uib.no (Torgeir Veimo) Subject: virtual sound  I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is the following;  From a fast source` eg. a CDROM` several sound sources are read` each having it's own defined position and other attributes` eg. direction etc.  Given the listeners position and direction` the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear` and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given angle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the source.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some r,18

There are two ways to do this:  use a somewhat tricky but by-now well examined linear-time algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary` or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull routine and accept O(n log n).  Both methods are discussed in Preparata and Shamos` for example. ,18

I know no fixed version of the 6551. There are different possibilities to work around this bug. The easiest is to tie _CTS to GND and use _DSR or _DCD as _CTS. It should be easy to fix the software` _DSR is bit 6 and DCD ist bit 5 of the Status Register (Read 6551 with RS1 = low and RS0 = high).  Using the _CTS-line can lead into big trouble. The 6551 _instantly_ stops transmission if _CTS goes high. This means` that you may get o,0
From: JEK@cu.nih.gov Subject: etymology of "Easter"  for SRC  In most languages` the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is known as the PASCH` or PASQUE` or some variation thereof` a word which comes from the Hebrew PESACH` meaning "Passover." In English` German` and a few related languages` however` it is known as EASTER` or some variation thereof` and questions have been asked about the origin of this term.  One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5` where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar` and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735` and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess` based on his awareness that th,14

However` I am leary of this method because it a) requires a lot of parts` and` more importantly` b) creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire AC line.

Good statement! Should we apply empirical measurements to define exact social morals? Should morals be based on social rules? On ancient religious doctrines?

Once the evaluation was complete I duly deleted the software from my PC.  Unfortunately there is still a "ghost" of SPSS left: when I run something like "Write" and go to embed an object then "SPSS Chart" appears on the list of objects I'm offered. I looked around all the obvious "INI" files without success. The next thing I tried was looking for the string "SPSS Chart" in every file in the  Windows directory. It turned up in a file called REQ.DAT (or REG.DAT). Unfortunately the file was binary and so I didn't feel inclined to edit it.

If a  manifestation such as God is truly infinite in power can God place limits  upon itself? . . Some stuff I can't recall. Then some other questions I think I recall correctly: Can God unmake itself? Can God make itself (assuming it doesn't yet exist)? Has God has always existed or is it necessary for an observer to bind all of Gods potential quantum states into reality? Was God nothing more than a primordial force of nature that existed during the earliest stages of universal (inflationary?) creation? Is God a vacuum fluctuation? Given a great enough energy density could we re-create God? Would that make US God and God something else? . . Some more stuff I don't recall concerning creating God.  ,2

From: iacs3650@Oswego.EDU (Kevin Mundstock) Subject: Joe Robbie Stadium "NOT FOR BASEBALL"  Did anyone notice the words "NOT FOR BASEBALL" printed on the picture of Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USA Today? Any reason given for this?  Also` I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in the preview. On 8/22/89` Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout. On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91` Nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 939th base` which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of publicity at Rickey's expense. IMO` Rickey deserves it` and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They are both great players` but IMO` Nolan has outclassed Rickey` both in playing and more importantly` in attitude. Just my thoughts.  						Kevin ,11

The        peakups were successful. The observations were executed as        scheduled` and no problems were reported.       o Observations were made using the High Speed Photometer of the Planet        Uranus during an occultation by a faint star in Capricornus. These        observations will help in our understanding of the planet's        atmospheric radiative and dynamical processes. This event occurred        close to the last quarter moon` and special arrangements had to be        made to modify the lunar limit tests to allow these observations.        The observations are currently being reviewed` and all the        observations looked okay.       ___    _____     ___     /_ /|  /__,4

From: tlau@cs.ubc.ca (Tony Lau) Subject: 3-D widget wish list?  I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing 3-D interactive applications what types of 3-D widgets you would like to have in your applications.    A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the  application.  It may let you  - manipulate application data` the camera`   3-D objects in the scene and so on` or - view the status of the application or 3-D objects   via the widget's shape` color` position` orientation and so on` or - do whatever I missed but you think is possible.  For example` a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated. A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and feedback.  For ,18

It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew must learn to do physical labor` i.e. working the land; 2) The land in this country must pass into Jewish hands` i.e. to the same new Jew who has "learned" to work it. Both aspects of the two-pronged concept of "Hebrew labor" have racist connotations. On the one hand` the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other hand` its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood.

From: ddr@flux.isr.alaska.edu (Donald D Rice) Subject: Heavy-duty antenna simulation software   I would be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of good software for antenna simulation` particularly in source form suitable for Unix workstations (though good PC software would also be of interest). I'm aware of the numerous mininec mutations` and have been using MN for some time now.  I'm primarily interested in HF` VHF` and low UHF (< 500 MHz) designs` mostly wire antennas` but for thick wires and mesh surfaces as well as for your basic thin wire assumption. Is anything interesting happening with NEC itself?  I've seen a version that was mutilated to run (sort of) under Microsoft Fortran` but I'm not sure how many "new and improved" versions of the code might be out there somewhere.

If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed` there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second` it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third` it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts` and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog` there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates` and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.

These people are chosen for their intelligence` education` loyalty to the government` etc. They are given much intensive training. So` to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any conspiracy here` and say that the FBI was just stupid` I say I don't believe it.  2) The FBI has acces to the latest in audio and video technology -- the latest digital systems. The FBI can manufacture evidence. Need a tape of Koresh saying` "light the fire"` and you can have one. Need a thermal imaging video of three people lighting fires` and through the magic of computer graphics` you can have one. The thing is` manufacturing these pieces of evidence takes time.

Fifteen seconds before      TV commercials are gone to` Thirty or so before action begins upon     the return to the game.  Two minutes` last out to first pitch` or     a ball is called.  2.  Don't grant time to batters just because they want it.  They may get     pissed at first` but they'll get in line` once anything the pitcher     throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike.  3.  Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches (the current     rule is too lenient)` and then enforce it.  Fifteen seconds is more     than enough time.

We would like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between firings. The three that are being fired do not fire in the same direction.   To further explain the situation` assume we are firing sonars A`B`C 5 ms apart each other. We should normally see an echo on A that corresponds to the distance. However` sonar A detects the INIT line of sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A; we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer` exactly at the time the init line of sonar B is activated.   We feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference. We came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply for sonars B and C.

While I agree that Lemieux deserves the Hart` it is far from a "no-brainer".  The Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team` not to the best player in the league. So your above arguement is really worthless.   The Pens without Mario are still a damn good hockey team. The Leafs without  Gilmour would have been fighting Tampa Bay for the 3rd pick.   Like I said` Mario deserves it` IMHO. But it is a very close race and a  Gilmour victory would not surprise me. I dislike Doug Gilmour w,10

The pattern of the first game was repeated tonight` with the Canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period` only to stave off a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent.

Vancouver's big line produced again` with centre Cliff Ronning and left winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to  boost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of Bautin and Ulanov.

However` there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  This is evident in many letters.  For instance` Paul talks about the "super-apostles" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12)` he mentions how people will be led away by miracles` signs` and wonders (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)` he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4).

It's supposedly a high-performance chip based upon workstation graphics accelerators.  It's quite fast (I have 7)` but as usual with new boards/chips the drivers are buggy for Windows.  As far as Winmarks go` it depends upon the version.  I think I got 42M winmarks with version 3.11.  2.5 yielded the 50+ number.  I've also benchmarked this with Wintach at over 65 (from memory as well).  As far as the low-level stuff goes` it looks pretty nice.  It's got this quadrilateral fill command that requires just the four points.  It's very fast` but beware of buggy drivers` and otherwise no non-windows support.  -- I am not responsible for anything I do or say -- I'm just an opinion.   ,18

From: artmel@well.sf.ca.us (Arthur Melnick) Subject: Big Brother (Clipper) chip        There are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother (Clipper) chip.      The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985 the New York Times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them.      A Mr. Deely` an NSA official` said "There are a lot of medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group."      For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are.

But at the same time` the University of Denver study points    out` quite dramatically` that 60% of all self-identifying gay men have  > had some form of heterosexual contact in the past year.   I think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual  contact of any kind in the previous year` they are counted as heterosexual. Even if they didn't intend it that way` that's how the figures are being used.  ,13

From: pcw@access.digex.com (Peter Wayner) Subject: The Old Key Registration Idea...  Okay` let's suppose that the NSA/NIST/Mykotronix Registered Key system becomes standard and I'm able to buy such a system from my local radio shack. Every phone comes with a built in chip and the government has the key to every phone call.  I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key.   What's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or  buying a used phone at a garage sale? Whooa. The secret registered keys just became unsynchronized. When the government comes  to listen in` they only receive gobbledly-gook because the  secret key registered under my name isn't the right one.   That leads me to conjecture that:  1) The system isn't that secure. There are just two master keys that work for all the phones in the country. The part about registering your keys is just bogus.   or   2) The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks like this. Criminals will quickly figure this out,3

From: weber@sipi.usc.edu (Allan G. Weber) Subject: Need help with Mitsubishi P78U image printer  Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However` the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode` but they didn't have any information about how to program ,18

I'd like to be able to simply move my cursor into the window where that application is running (just a text window` xterm or some such) and have everything I type be entered as ALL CAPS.  When the cursor is in any of my many other windows` I want to automatically return to normal functionality.  I have point-to-type set.  Is there a way to do this in X (specifically OW 3.0 on SPARCs)?  Is there a way to mess with .Xdefaults to make a category of window do this?  Any hints would be most appreciated.  I program in C but not X` although I can pick up somthing that's not too involved.  Thanks kindly. --  Kevin Weinrich     Computer Sciences Corp. kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov ,16
Subject: Put ex. syquest in Centris 610? From: kmoffatt@cstp.umkc.edu  I remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external syquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a Centris. . . I was going to do that with my 610` but had a couple of questions.  My PLI 80M syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the outside of the case.  Where do I connect this switch??  Can the computer just "tell" with internal drives?   	I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (I didn't look closely` but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that's soldered onto the motherboard?  Would that cause problems? 	One last question!  Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover?   the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the drive's panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone's cases).  Should I just cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place?  Ans are welcomed!  Thanks!,19

I accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from ONE particular box of diskettets in the A drive when I boot up` rather than getting the "Non-system diskette" message` the machine hangs and the CMOS gets overwritten (luckily` Gateway sends a print of the standard CMOS settings with their systems).  This only happens with a box of pre-formatted Fuji disks that I have` no other disks cause this problem.  If I re-format one of the Fuji disks` the problem goes away. I did a virus scan (scan v1.02) of the disks and found nothing.  Anyone have any idea what is going on here?  Hardware problem?  A virus that can't be detected?

You do need an adaptor (I use a Mac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two machines.

My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our first child (due June 15th).  We interviewed a young doctor last week and were very impressed with her.  However` I discovered that she is actually not an Medical Doctor (M.D.) but rather a "Doctor of  Osteopathy" (D.O.).  What's the difference?  I believe the pediatrician *I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he didn't seem different from any other doctor I've seen over the years.  My dictionary says that osteopathy is "a medical therapy that emphasizes manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought to cause disease and inhibit recovery."  Jeez` this sounds like chiropractic.  I remember getting shots and medicine from *my* pediatrician D.O.` and don't remember any  "manipulative techniques".  Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the real` practical difference between an M.D. a,6

Before I delve into its innards` I thought I'd check "net.wisdom" on the subject. :)  It's a 1985 Buick Skyhawk (I know...I know) 2.0l EFI 4-banger auto 35k miles  When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of getting "stuck" in 3rd gear.  As a result` when you stop for a light the motor stalls.  Putting the car in park` and waiting for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to "reset" and go back into 1st.  Otherwise` it just stalls when put in drive.    My thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The least likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum hose has broken/cracked and this behavi,9

Similar prizes have influenced aerospace  development before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of  Saint Louis venture to his financial backers.

I have only one report` which seems to indicate that a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! Access to memory takes LONGER when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card of 32K may be worth $0. I don't know what kind of numbers 64K cards get you.

It could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered by moisture or damp air` which would short out the terminals.

The solution (for the car) is to clean the plug leads and spray with WD-40 (moisture repellant).  If damp *is* the problem` then storing the  battery off the ground may help.

From: myers@cs.scarolina.edu (Daniel Myers) Subject: Re: Is MSG sensitivity superstition?  Frequently of late` I have been reacting to something added to restaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts to feel "puffy"` like I have a cold` and also at times the inside of my mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.  The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants (usually chinese)` the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food chain` a japanese steak house (I had the steak)` and another chinese fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.

This is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable.  For example` why does the earth's atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive answer is "photosynthesis"` but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated` as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material.  On earth` this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter` mostly from oceanic sources.  However` th,4

I never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when running desqview` but Win3.1 and W4W2.0 constantly crash on me` most commonly citing a "memory parity error."  The only thing I can do is TURN OFF and re-boot.  My CMOS ticks off & counts all the memory every startup` and there is never a problem with this either.  Could it be a bug in my Windows copy instead of the hardware?  I remember having some disk error problems when installing it.   Is there any change I could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of this happening (I think win vs win /s produce different crashes` but both crash frequently nonetheless)  I know this is a pain` but PLEASE answer by EMAIL because my home account doesn't have rn.  And I will stop asking questions now.  Thank you. Chet Pager = chetter@ucthpx.uct.ac.za ,5

I'd be inclined to take two teeth off the rear for a 5% ratio change rather than adding one to the front for about 7%.

My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service: And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80.

They do not have a coprocessor on board` but any software query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the coproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the actual coprocessor.  The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit rate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance boost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a 386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.

The recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search attack   against DES is quite feasible now. But normally DES is applied in CBC or CFB   mode where one chooses a random init vector of 8 bytes. Questions:   - Makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key? Then we have   a 56 + 64 = 120 bit key.    - If yes: Is anything known about the security of this key scheme? Can we   break it faster than by exhaustive search through the 120 bit key space?  -- Klaus Pommerening Institut fuer Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation der Johannes-Gutenberg-Universitaet Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 69` W-6500 Mainz` Germany ,3

From: Amruth Laxman <al26+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject: Surviving Large Accelerations?  Hi`     I was reading through "The Spaceflight Handbook" and somewhere in there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to the sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of course. If these are possible` what is used to absorb the acceleration? Can this be extended to larger accelerations?  Thanks is advance... -Amruth Laxman  ,4

I was worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim.  I have also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident.  I'm interestend in determining whether or not these things are true. Has anyone out there with Geico made a claim?

We'll let you live` but just this once....  There's more to a real "storage" scope than just a long-persistence phosphor.  Actually` the phosphor ISN'T usually anything special at all; what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor` which becomes charged as the electron beam intially "writes" the trace. With the trace now written to the screen` a separate low-level "flood" electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor which are next to the "written" areas on the storage screen.  There are some problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage tube` and the stored trace tends to "bloom" with time.   Of course` this is pretty much obsolete techno,0

Our shop uses a package called CADCore - very good - to scan and subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps.

One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that in our internal LYMB system.  We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of dial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then drawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knob's state and changes to the next pixmap in the sequence.  Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular portion of the parent widget` but that's normally not a big shortcoming.

Stephen` I suspect that when you and I use the word "Hell`" we have different concepts in mind. When you encounter references to Heaven in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets` I trust that you do not suppose (or suspect Christians of supposing) that the golden streets are to be taken literally` still less that they are what the concept of Heaven is all about. Why then should you suppose that about the "fires" of Hell?      Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED? Do you remember the last description of James Taggart` sitting on the floor beside the Ferris Persuader? This comes close to a description of what is meant by Hell in my circles. If the image of fire is often used in this connection` there are two reasons that occur to me.,14

Fox was on Letterman about a year ago (or two) during the  playoffs as a celebrity hockey player for the Bruins.  While he's not exactly a NHLer he did mention that the Bruins wanted to break Ulfie's legs (or something like that) in response to the Neely incident.

Apparently a message M is encrypted as E_G(E_{U_C}(K_P)`C) ` E_{K_P}(M). That's it.  The system as described here can't possibly work. What happens when someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip? To get M the receiving chip needs K_P; to get K_P the receiving chip needs U_C. The only information it can work with is C.

I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system. Well` I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.  The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons). For example` in the letter "O" there are two outlines:  	1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font) 	2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.  One common solution use,18

Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could` but the server did not create cursors of that size. Investigation showed that some X servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window` while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware - a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK` while a Sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs.  Actually` the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this behavior correct?

There's really no simple way to tell this is the case.  You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool.  You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources.  Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit()  regularly. ,16

Stewart` being an ex-Nordique himself` was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!  It was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous goalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau was serving a penalty.  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the last 5 min. of the game` but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.  The Nords were caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once.

From: dcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk (Derek C. Richardson) Subject: XView 3.0 window positioning problems  I don't seem to be able to get window positions reliably through the XView xv_get() function:     x = (int) xv_get(my_frame` XV_X);    y = (int) xv_get(my_frame` XV_Y);  For example` if I set XV_X & XV_Y to 50`50 the frame comes up in the correct position` with the top left corner (the size handle) at 50`50. xv_get() returns 50`50 as well. But later on xv_get() returns 5`25 without any intervening xv_set(my_frame` XV_?). My frame is fitted around a canvas` and it turns out (by measuring on the screen) that 5`25 is the position of the first pixel in my canvas relative to the frame's origin. What gives? Any help most appreciated!  Derek  P.S. On a related subject` is there any way of querying the window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around frames` etc.?  ----------------------------------------------------------- | Derek C.

There's a better way. Doesn't Qualcom have a secure design         that it decided not to market?  Since they aren't going to         use it` wouldn't the patriotic thing be to put the design in         the public domain?
